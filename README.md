# AnsiblePlaybooks

These are a collection of Ansible playbooks that are designed to configure a Kali machine to my preferred setup and install a bunch of tools I commonly use. 

All of these were designed to be run on Kali boxes, but they should work on all Debian based distros (famous last words).

The `fish.yml` playbook is expected to be ran first as it installs `virtualfish`, `pipenv` & all the environment variables needed for them to play nice together.
